Q: How many seconds are in a year?
A: Think step by step. There are 60 seconds in a minute...
### Response:
Here's how to break down the calculation:

* **Seconds in a minute:** 60 seconds
* **Minutes in an hour:** 60 minutes
* **Hours in a day:** 24 hours
* **Days in a year:** 365 days (or 366 in a leap year)

Now, let's multiply to find the total seconds:

1. **Seconds in an hour:** 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 seconds/hour
2. **Seconds in a day:** 3600 seconds/hour * 24 hours/day = 86,400 seconds/day
3. **Seconds in a year:** 86,400 seconds/day * 365 days/year = **31,536,000 seconds/year**

**Therefore, there are approximately 31,536,000 seconds in a year.**
