I installed GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code as my code assistant due to its powerful AI-driven suggestions, seamless integration with VS Code, and support for multiple programming languages. Copilot's ability to learn from my coding patterns and accelerate development, especially for repetitive tasks, was a key factor. VS Code was chosen for its lightweight nature, extensibility, and broad language support, making it an ideal platform for Copilot. The combination promises to enhance my coding efficiency and productivity.
