I installed GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code as my code assistant due to its powerful AI-driven suggestions, seamless integration with VS Code, and support for multiple programming languages. Copilot's ability to learn from my coding patterns and accelerate development, especially for repetitive tasks, was a key factor. VS Code was chosen for its lightweight nature, extensibility, and broad language support, making it an ideal platform for Copilot. The combination promises to enhance my coding efficiency and productivity.

The use of GitHub Copilot greatly facilitated my code writing task thanks to the autocomplete option, which allowed me to save seconds in coding. However, it could sometimes be a bit intrusive and occasionally suggested nonsensical things or automatically completed inappropriately, which made it obstructive. On the positive side, the chat option allowed me to resolve specific doubts about what I was writing in my code files and even greatly helped me find effective solutions to some problems in a simpler and more comfortable way
